# Noise Reduction in Communication Systems

This project demonstrates basic noise reduction techniques applied to communication signals using Python.

## Techniques Implemented
- Signal generation with additive noise
- Low-pass filtering
- High-pass filtering
- Signal visualization using Matplotlib

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Purpose
To analyze how filtering techniques improve signal quality by reducing noise, demonstrating fundamental digital signal processing concepts.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run any script:
   python signal_generation.py
